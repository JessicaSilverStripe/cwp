# Documentation

The docs site contains all the CWP-specific documentation as well as links to the general documentation for the
SilverStripe CMS.

## Access

Docs are public resource.

## Modules

Each module (subset of SilverStripe functionality) that has relevant documentation is included in the navigation
displayed just under the title. The "cwp" module includes all the CWP-specific documentation, not only just about the
CMS modifications made for the platform but also the higher-level documentation about the platform (such as this page)
and developer guides.

## Adding documentation

The documentation is automatically compiled from the docs in the cwp module. There are two ways of contributing to the
documentation: writing it yourself, or suggesting a topic that needs further documentation.

To write your own documentation, you need to create a new branch of the CWP module (found at 
[https://gitlab.cwp.govt.nz/cwp/cwp](https://gitlab.cwp.govt.nz/cwp/cwp)) and make your edits there. The documentation
is found in the /docs/en/ folder, and is written in the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
format. When you are happy with your additions, merge in the latest changes from the master branch and then request
that your branch be merged. This is just an overview of the process, for a fuller walkthrough of the branching and
merging process see the Gitlab documentation.

To suggest documentation, just email [cwp@silverstripe.com](mailto:cwp@silverstripe.com).

## General documentation

The CWP docs site contains only the documentation specific to CWP. There is a much larger base of documentation that
covers all aspects of working with the SilverStripe CMS both as a developer or a content administrator. This is linked
to from the relevant places within the CWP documentation.

The developer documentation is available here:
[http://doc.silverstripe.org/framework/en/](http://doc.silverstripe.org/framework/en/)

The user documentation is available from within the SilverStripe CMS (the "Help" tab at the bottom left), and also
here: [userhelp.silverstripe.org](userhelp.silverstripe.org)
