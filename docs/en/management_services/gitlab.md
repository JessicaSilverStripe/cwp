# Gitlab overview

Git is the version control system that CWP uses to manage the code powering websites on the platform. Gitlab is Git
management software that allows easy browsing and sharing of source-code and user access control.

This documentation provides only an overview of Gitlab, for a more thorough explaining of its capabilities and
step-by-step guides see the developer documentation.

## Access

As part of the Management Services login PTCs and ITCs are given initial Gitlab account that has ability to create
more users. From this point on, all user management for Gitlab is left in the hands of the ITC (or PTC). They
are free to create as many users as they want and as many additional repositories as they need. New users can be
created with the privileges to create new users and new repositories.

If a technical contact loses access and needs their Management Services password reset they can request this through the
helpdesk.
