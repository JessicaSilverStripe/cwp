# Subsites

The subsites module allows you to host multiple discrete websites from inside one instance. Common use cases are for
small sites that don't warrant an entire unique site, such as a campaign, festival or expo site, or individual websites
for offices around the country.

Subsites can share page types, content, files and themes, or they can use their own as necessary.

For more information, see the [subsites module documentation](../../../subsites/en).
