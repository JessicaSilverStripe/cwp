# Workflow

Advanced workflow is a module that allows you to set up workflows and attach them to different parts of your site.
Workflows require that draft changes must go through approval processes before being published.

The module also allows you to set up embargo and expiry dates on your pages.

By default this module comes installed on every CWP-hosted site, but it may have been removed by a developer since.

You can read the documentation on the module, including a tutorial on setting up a workflow from scratch,
