# Documentation

The docs site contains all the CWP-specific documentation as well as links to the general documentation for the
SilverStripe CMS.

## Access

Every user on the CWP platform has access to the entire CWP documentation site. There is no need to manually manage
access to the documentation or different sections of it.

## Modules

Each module (subset of SilverStripe functionality) that has relevant documentation is included in the navigation
displayed just under the title. The "cwp" module includes all the CWP-specific documentation, not only just about the
CMS modifications made for the platform but also the higher-level documentation about the platform (such as this page)
and developer guides.

## General documentation

The CWP docs site contains only the documentation specific to CWP. There is a much larger base of documentation that
covers all aspects of working with the SilverStripe CMS both as a developer or a content administrator. This is linked
to from the relevant places within the CWP documentation.

The developer documentation is available here:
[http://doc.silverstripe.org/framework/en/](http://doc.silverstripe.org/framework/en/)

The user documentation is available from within the SilverStripe CMS (the "Help" tab at the bottom left), and also
here: [userhelp.silverstripe.org](userhelp.silverstripe.org)
