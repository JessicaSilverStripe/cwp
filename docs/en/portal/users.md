# Users and Access

There are two different groups of users in the Common Web Platform, and two different levels of access.

## Groups

Access can be agency-wide or restricted to certain instances.

Agency-wide users have access to all instances run by their agency. This will be the typical arrangement for smaller
agencies or once with just a few websites.

Instance users just have access to just the instances they have been allowed access to. This could be used for large
agencies with multiple business groups, each with their own set of websites. It also could be used for external
development agencies that are contracted to work on only one or two websites from an agency. Actually the instances
that they have access to could be across multiple agencies and CWP supports this arrangement.

## Level of access

All users have the ability to request actions through the helpdesk - actions such as deploying to live, creating a new
user, or creating a new instance. Some of these actions, those that carry some expense or could possibly lead to an
outage (such as a deployment) require authorisation by a more privileged user, the technical contact.

When such a request is made, first the service provider will contact the instance-specific technical contact (if there
is one). If there is no instance-specific technical contact, or if no reply is received, then the request is escalated
up to the agency technical contact.

The agency technical contact is also the only user that can authorise the creation of a new instance for that agency.

## User management

Users can be managed through the [CWP helpdesk](http://helpdesk.cwp.govt.nz). Requests can be made to add a new user,
change instance access, remove users or reset a users's password.
