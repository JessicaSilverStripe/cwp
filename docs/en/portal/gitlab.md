# Gitlab

Git is the version control system that CWP uses to manage the code powering websites on the platform. Gitlab is Git
management software that allows easy browsing and sharing of source-code and user access control.

This documentation provides only an overview of Gitlab, for a more thorough explaining of its capabilities and
step-by-step guides see the developer documentation.

## Access

When a new instance is created, the technical contact is given an account for Gitlab and access to all the applicable
repositories. From this point on, all user management for Gitlab is left in the hands of the technical contact. They
are free to create as many users as they want and as many additional repositories as they need. New users can be
created with the privileges to create new users and new repositories.

If a technical contact loses access and needs their password reset they can request this through the helpdesk.
