summary: Set up an instance with multiple websites

# Subsites

The subsites module provides a convenient way of running multiple websites from a single installation of SilverStripe, sharing users, content, and assets between them - the sites will be managed from a single CMS.

For more information about the subsites module go to the [github repository](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-subsites/) and go to [user documentation](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/optional_features/working_with_multiple_sites/) for more information about setting up a subsite in the CMS.

# Setup

The subsites module is already included as part of the cwp default installation. To set up a subsite in the CMS visit the [user documentation](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/optional_features/working_with_multiple_sites/set_up).

## Go live

See [DNS/Go-live](working-with-cwp/instance-management/dns-go-live/) for more information about setting up your NDS configuration for subsites.
