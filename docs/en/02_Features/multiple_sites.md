title: Multiple sites
summary: Set up an instance with multiple websites

# Subsites

The subsites module provides a convenient way of running multiple websites from a single installation of SilverStripe, sharing users, content, and assets between them - the sites will be managed from a single CMS.

For more information about the subsites module go to the [github repository](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-subsites/) and go to [user documentation](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/optional_features/working_with_multiple_sites/) for more information about setting up a subsite in the CMS.

# Setup

The subsites module is already included as part of the CWP basic recipe. To set up a subsite in the CMS visit the [user documentation](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/optional_features/working_with_multiple_sites/set_up).

# Technical

There is a good [overview](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-subsites/blob/1.2/docs/en/introduction.md) to get you familiarised with the module and if you wish to extend the existing subsites architecture then there is some [technical](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-subsites/blob/1.2/docs/en/technical.md) documentation to get you started.
