# CMS Reports

## Default reports

### Summary statistics report

Summary statistics report gives you access to metrics that will help you determine if your site fits on the given
instance size. The most important number here is "Total live page count, across all translations and subsites", which
can be compared directly with the "Max pages in CMS" listed in the instance size specifications.

To look at the report, go to the "Reports" section and select "Summary statistics" from the list.

## Developing custom reports
Custom reports can be created quickly and easily. A general knowledge of SilverStripe CMS's datamodel and ORM is useful before creating a custom report.

See [Customising site reports](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/3.2/developer_guides/customising_the_admin_interface/how_tos/customise_site_reports/) in the Official SilverStripe CMS documentation
