summary: Adding translated content to your website.

# Translations

The SilverStripe Translatable module allows you to create and edit multiple pages in various languages. This module also adds the ability for your users to select which language of a page they wish to view.

<div class="notice" markdown='1'>The SilverStripe Translatable module does not translate content automatically, content authors will need to enter the translated content manually for each translated page</div>

# Setup

The translatable module is already included as part of the CWP basic recipe and the default CWP theme is set up to switch between different languages. To set up a new translation in the CMS visit the [user documentation](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/3.2/optional_features/working_with_translations/about-translatable/).

# Technical

There are some [caveats](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-translatable/blob/master/docs/en/index.md#caveats) to the translatable module which are worth reviewing and for advanced implementation details refer to the [usage](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-translatable/blob/master/docs/en/index.md#usage-1) documentation.
