title: Features of the default codebase
summary: Technical implementation, configuration and developer guides for each default feature of a CWP website.
introduction: This section details major features available in the default recipe codebase that provide CWP specific development and configuration information. 

Features specific to CWP only will be documented in this section and many of the default features are well documented alongside the open source modules that enable them. 
Where possible you'll be directed to the open source documentation as they are the most up to date and useful when looking to customise your SilverStripe CMS website for CWP.

**For general SilverStripe CMS development development, ensure you are using the [official SilverStripe CMS developer documentation](http://docs.silverstripe.org).**
