# Documentation conventions

## General

Use informal voice when writing documentation: "isn't" instead of "is not", "I'm" instead of "I am".

Page types are highlighted as follows: **News Holder**, and written as they appear in the *Add page* screen.

Any names that appear in the CMS as they are presented are written as: *Page name*. This includes area names, field 
names, buttons and so on.

For example links, use "http://newzealand.govt.nz/".

## CMS areas

For the purpose of documentation, CMS is a collection of "areas", each one mapping to distinct URL.

Large areas of the CMS that can be navigated through the CMS menu on the left are called "sections". For example: 
*Pages* section, *Files* section and so on.

CMS areas that are used like modal dialogs or wizards are called "screens". E.g. *Add page* screen.

Sub-areas within specific sections that are accessible via tabbed navigation are called "subsections". E.g. *Content*
subsection in *Page* section. The tabs under subsections are called, as you'd expect, "tabs". E.g. *Main Content* tab in
*Content* subsection.

Note: the *Pages* section opens up in the *Edit Tree* screen before a page has been selected. It's assumed that
subsections of this section refer to the areas presented when a page has been selected from the tree.

CMS areas that are self-contained and often provide extra capabilities are called "panels". E.g. tree panel in the
*Pages* section, or *Filter* panel in *Files* section.

## Area paths

This is a method of pointing out a CMS area in a very concise way. It is assumed the reader has a general knowledge
about the CMS navigation here.

A "path" is given as *Pages / Main Content / Content / URL Segment*. The default composition of such path is: "section /
subsection / tab / field". 

If the tab is not available, the last element provided could become a field instead, as in *Pages / Settings / Page
type*. The screens could also be included in the paths, as in *Pages / Add new* or *Pages / Edit tree*.

A degree of flexibility in area paths is assumed.
