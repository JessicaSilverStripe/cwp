# Accessibility

There are a few easy ways to add extra information to the media on your website to enable it to be accessed by people
of all abilities and disabilities. Doing so will not only increase your potential audience and not discriminate against
some of your users, but will also open up your rich video and audio content to be indexed by search engines such as
Google and Bing.

Further guidelines on accessibility can be found in [Making your web content
accessible](http://3.0.userhelp.silverstripe.org/for-website-content-editors/web-content-best-practices/#making-your-content-accessible).

## Images

When using the *Insert Media* editor button for adding or editing embedded images, it is recommended to configure the
alternative text. This is used to describe the image when the user is using a screen reader to interact with the
website. See the link above for more details.

## Video and Audio

After adding video or audio content to your site you should provide a transcript. This is a text description of the
content so that a user unable to view or listen to the media will be able to read through the content it contains using
a screen reader. This should be regular page content directly after the video or audio, or on a separate page linked to
from near the media.
