* *Page types*: words highlighted **in bold** signify page types. These are the pages that can be created through the
*Add page* screen and include some defaults such as **Page** and **Redirector page**. See [Managing your
site](http://userhelp.silverstripe.org/for-website-content-editors/managing-your-site/) and
[CWP page types](page_types) for more details.
* *Sections*: large areas of the CMS that can be navigated through the CMS menu on the left, for example *Pages* section.
* *Subsections and tabs*: these are seen on the top right of the interface and can be navigated accordingly. Some sections
will not have subsections at all - just tabs.
* *Screens*: standalone areas that perform specific functions in the CMS, such as the *Add page* screen accessible from
the *Pages* section.
* *Panels*: self-contained areas that often provide extra capabilities, for example the tree panel in the *Pages* section,
or *Filter* panel in *Files* section.
