# 2.2.0

## Security considerations

CWP recommends ensuring that outgoing embed requests in TinyMCE are locked down to a specific list of known domains,
such as youtube.com or vimeo.com. We also recommend disabling the HTTP protocol and enforcing HTTPS for these requests.
See the ["Security" section](../working_with_projects/security#whitelist-embed-domains) for more information.
