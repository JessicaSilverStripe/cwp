summary: How to contribute translations to CWP recipe modules.

# Contributing translations

Translations of the natural language strings are managed through a third party translation interface,
[Transifex](http://transifex.com). Newly added strings will be periodically uploaded there for translation, and any new
translations will be merged back to the project source code.

Please register on Transifex and you will be able to contribute to all modules. Here is a list of translation projects
for CWP-hosted modules:

* [cwp/cwp](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/silverstripe-cwp/)
* [cwp/cwp-core](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/silverstripe-cwp-core/)
* [silverstripe/documentconverter](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/silverstripe-documentconverter/)
