# Developer documentation for SilverStripe CMS on CWP

This codebase is referred to as the CWP `Recipe` and is made up of your own custom developed code alongside:
 
 * SilverStripe CMS (open source CMS product).
 * SilverStripe commercially supported modules (which deliverers many of the default features). 
 * Two CWP specific modules (cwp and cwp-core) that implement specific configuration and features related to running websites on CWP.

For general information about working with SilverStripe CMS code, please consult the
[Official SilverStripe CMS developer documentation](https://docs.silverstripe.org/). 
We will point developers towards the official documentation when appropriate while ensuring CWP specific development guides are maintained in this documentation.

If you are completely new to SilverStripe CMS development, then you might like
to work through the online SilverStripe CMS [development lessons](https://www.silverstripe.org/learn/lessons/) or attend an [in-person introductory workshop](http://www.silverstripe.com/what-we-do/services/training/#jumpstart-course/).
