title: Add a blogroll
-->

# Introduction

A blogroll is a useful feature to have on the sidebar of a blog, which may link to other third party websites
which may be helpful to visitors.

Within the CMS this is implemented as a [widget](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-widgets) which can
be added to the sidebar by any user with edit permissions. Any HTML content such as links, images, formatting can
be used to customise this content.

This feature is included in the 1.1.0 release of the CWP recipe.

## Adding the widget

* Within the CMS pages section select a blog, or other page with widgets enabled.
* On the "Widgets" tab add a "HTML Content" widget.
* Enter the content you wish to have appear in the blog sidebar into the content area and select "Save & Publish"
* If you want this to appear on child pages, ensure that the "inherit sidebar" flag is checked by default.
