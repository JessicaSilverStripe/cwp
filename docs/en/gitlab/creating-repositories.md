# Creating a project/repository

In Gitlab, a **Project** is also considered to be a repository.

Create a new one by clicking the **New Project** button in the Gitlab **Dashboard**.

## Making the project public

Unless you don't want others to see it, you can create your project public by going to **Edit** tab while
viewing your project in Gitlab and checking the **Public clone access** checkbox.

This will mean anyone can `git checkout` your project.

It will also be listed on the [Gitlab Public Projects](http://gitlab.cwp.govt.nz/public) list.
