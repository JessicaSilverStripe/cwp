# Gitlab Setup 

This how to is intended for the development agencies. It details the initial process you should follow to configure your Gitlab repository.

## Your Gitlab Repository

When an instance is created you will be given a  primary Gitlab project that all code changes need to be uploaded to.

This project will be used by any test and production servers - the code which ends up on the different environment servers can only be installed from this repository.

## Configure Your Gitlab Profile and Primary Project

Once you've logged in to your Gitlab repository (your password would've been e-mailed to your given e-mail address) then go to your profile and:

* Verify your details are correct
* Add your public SSH key(s)
* Ensure that the correct starting point exists (with the default CWP or CMS recipe)
* Create README.md and LICENSE, commit and push to the primary project
